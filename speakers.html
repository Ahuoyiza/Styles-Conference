            <h4>King O. Jide</h4>
            <h3>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h3>
            <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it<br>
                 doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior,<br>
                  beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a<br>
                   workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to<br>
                    work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In King's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get*<br>
                 design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and<br>
                  companies have that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your<br>
                   own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design it’s almost<br>
                    impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.
            </p>
            <h3>ABOUT KING</h3>
            <p>
                King Jide is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a<br>
                 foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations,br>
                  on the conversation surrounding design over at discussingdesign.com.

            <h3>MAKING REMOTE DEVELOPMENT WORK</h3>
            <p>
                It’s not uncommon for developers and designers to work from home. There are also a<br>
                 few companies that have multiple offices. Working for a business that spans three<br>
                  different time zones, Ize Oteve will show how you make cross-office collaboration<br>
                   work. She will suggest various helpful tools because constant communication is key.
            </p>
            <h3>ABOUT IZE</h3>
            <p>
                Ize Oteve is a User Interface Developer at Dominion Marine Media as well as a<br>
                 Customer Advocate at A Book Apart. Aside from researching about user experience<br>
                  and design patterns, she also loves mentoring college students about the front-end side<br>
                   of the web. She also enjoys participating in hackathons with other co-workers and<br>

            <h3>THE BUSINESS OF PLAY</h3>
            <p>
                Play isn’t just for kids and heavy gamers. Anyone with a Foursquare account knows that<br>
                 – and the stickiness of a badge and a leaderboard. But a good, playful user experience<br>
                  isn’t about those surface elements either – it’s about creating an environment with well- <br>
                  understood rules, meaningful objectives, and a sense of fun. Whether you’re trying to<br>
                   encourage people – or yourself – to save money or to lose weight, a focus on game<br>
                    mechanics and play could be the trump card you’re looking for.
            </p>
